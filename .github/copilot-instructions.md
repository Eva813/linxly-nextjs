## CODING_PRACTICES

### Guidelines for SUPPORT_LEVEL

#### SUPPORT_EXPERT

- Favor elegant, maintainable solutions over verbose code. Assume understanding of language idioms and design patterns.
- Highlight potential performance implications and optimization opportunities in suggested code.
- Frame solutions within broader architectural contexts and suggest design alternatives when appropriate.
- Focus comments on 'why' not 'what' - assume code readability through well-named functions and variables.
- Proactively address edge cases, race conditions, and security considerations without being prompted.
- When debugging, provide targeted diagnostic approaches rather than shotgun solutions.
- Suggest comprehensive testing strategies rather than just example tests, including considerations for mocking, test organization, and coverage.


### Guidelines for VERSION_CONTROL

#### GIT

- Use conventional commits to create meaningful commit messages
- Use feature branches with descriptive names following {{branch_naming_convention}}
- Write meaningful commit messages that explain why changes were made, not just what
- Keep commits focused on single logical changes to facilitate code review and bisection
- Use interactive rebase to clean up history before merging feature branches
- Leverage git hooks to enforce code quality checks before commits and pushes

#### GITHUB

- Use pull request templates to standardize information provided for code reviews
- Implement branch protection rules for {{protected_branches}} to enforce quality checks
- Configure required status checks to prevent merging code that fails tests or linting
- Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD workflows to automate testing and deployment
- Implement CODEOWNERS files to automatically assign reviewers based on code paths
- Use GitHub Projects for tracking work items and connecting them to code changes


## FRONTEND

### Guidelines for REACT

#### NEXT_JS

- Use App Router and Server Components for improved performance and SEO
- Implement route handlers for API endpoints instead of the pages/api directory
- Use server actions for form handling and data mutations from Server Components
- Leverage Next.js Image component with proper sizing for core web vitals optimization
- Implement the Metadata API for dynamic SEO optimization
- Use React Server Components for {{data_fetching_operations}} to reduce client-side JavaScript
- Implement Streaming and Suspense for improved loading states
- Use the new Link component without requiring a child <a> tag
- Leverage parallel routes for complex layouts and parallel data fetching
- Implement intercepting routes for modal patterns and nested UIs

#### ZUSTAND

- Create separate stores for distinct state domains instead of one large store
- Use immer middleware for complex state updates to maintain immutability when dealing with nested data
- Implement selectors to derive state and prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Leverage the persist middleware for automatic state persistence in localStorage or other storage
- Use TypeScript with strict typing for store definitions to catch errors at compile time
- Prefer shallow equality checks with useShallow for performance optimization in component re-renders
- Combine stores using composition for sharing logic between stores
- Implement subscriptions to react to state changes outside of React components
- Use devtools middleware for Redux DevTools integration in development
- Create custom hooks to encapsulate store access and related business logic

#### REACT_ROUTER

- Use createBrowserRouter instead of BrowserRouter for better data loading and error handling
- Implement lazy loading with React.lazy() for route components to improve initial load time
- Use the useNavigate hook instead of the navigate component prop for programmatic navigation
- Leverage loader and action functions to handle data fetching and mutations at the route level
- Implement error boundaries with errorElement to gracefully handle routing and data errors
- Use relative paths with dot notation (e.g., "../parent") to maintain route hierarchy flexibility
- Utilize the useRouteLoaderData hook to access data from parent routes
- Implement fetchers for non-navigation data mutations
- Use route.lazy() for route-level code splitting with automatic loading states
- Implement shouldRevalidate functions to control when data revalidation happens after navigation


## DATABASE

### Guidelines for NOSQL

#### FIREBASE

- Use security rules to enforce access control at the database level for {{user_roles}}
- Implement shallow queries to minimize bandwidth usage
- Use offline capabilities for better user experience in mobile apps
