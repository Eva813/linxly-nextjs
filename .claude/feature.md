Prompt Space Feature – Product Requirements Document
Background & Context
Product/Feature Name: Prompt Space Management System

Platform: Web Application (Sidebar Enhancement Feature)

Background:
The current system already supports a folder and prompt structure with corresponding APIs. On top of this existing structure, we need to introduce a higher-level organizational layer called promptSpace to improve workspace separation and context switching.

1. Executive Summary
Feature Overview:
Prompt Space introduces a new organizational level above the existing folder structure. It allows users to create and switch between different workspaces for their prompts. Each space contains its own set of folders and prompts, providing better organization and contextual separation.
Users can access and manage these spaces via a dropdown menu at the top of the sidebar.

Business Value:

Enhances project organization capabilities for users

Enables better contextual separation

Lays the foundation for future collaboration features

Definition of Success:
Existing user data is successfully migrated to a default space. Users can create and switch between spaces without issues.

2. Problem & Solution
Current Situation:
Users currently manage all folders and prompts within a single layer, making it difficult to separate different projects or use cases.

Solution:
Introduce promptSpace as the top-level organizational unit. Each space will contain an independent set of folders and prompts.

3. Functional Requirements
Core Features
Space Selector: A dropdown menu at the top of the sidebar, defaulting to "Workspace"

Switch Space: Users can click the dropdown to switch between different promptSpaces

Add New Space: A "+" button allows users to create a new space

Data Migration: Existing folders/prompts are automatically assigned to a default space (name: promptSpace-Default)

User Stories
Story 1: Switch Workspaces
As a user, I want to switch between different promptSpaces so that I can manage prompts for different projects.

Acceptance Criteria:

Dropdown shows the name of the currently selected space

Clicking opens a list of all available spaces

Selecting a space triggers an immediate switch and reload of folder/prompt list

The currently selected space is clearly indicated in the UI

Story 2: Create New Space
As a user, I want to create a new workspace to organize prompts for a new project.

Acceptance Criteria:

"+" button appears next to the dropdown menu

Clicking the button opens a modal asking for the new space name

After creation, the UI automatically switches to the new space

A default folder is created within the new space

Story 3: Data Migration
As an existing user, my data should be automatically preserved in the default space.

Acceptance Criteria:

All existing folders and prompts are assigned to promptSpace-default

The default space is automatically selected on first use

No data is lost in the migration process

4. Backend Changes
Database Schema:
New Table: prompt_spaces with fields: id, user_id, name, created_at

Add prompt_space_id column to folders table

Add prompt_space_id column to prompts table

Consider Firestore quota optimization

API Endpoints:
GET /api/prompt-spaces – Retrieve all spaces for the user

POST /api/prompt-spaces – Create a new space

Update existing folder/prompt APIs to include space-based filtering

Data Migration:
For new users, automatically create a default space (promptSpace-default)

Associate all existing folders/prompts with this default space

5. Frontend Changes
UI Components:
Dropdown selector component for promptSpaces

Modal dialog for creating new spaces

Loading indicators for state transitions

State Management:
Currently selected promptSpace state

Cache for the list of available spaces

Trigger data reload and navigate to the first folder when switching spaces
